![A screenshot of my Sprite Packer application]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projects/SpritePacker/packer-demo.png)

### About

After we created our own 2D game engine with glew, glfw, and OpenGL, we set out to create our own sprite packer using C# and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) toolkit.

This basic sprite packer is capable of accepting a number of images and then assembling them into a spritesheet with a set pixel spacing between each image.
