Why did shooting take two weeks to implement? Why don't we have a game playable four weeks in? Could we have had levels with premade assets instead of creating everything from the ground up? I wish I had known the answers to these questions many weeks ago. Let's try to take a step back and figure out what happened this time around.

On January 22nd, 2015, our teacher announced the three projects that were moving into the prototype phase of development. My project, then referred to as "Z-FPS", was the top voted project. The idea was simple: have short but intense levels that could easily be retried without losing too much progress or time. The twist was the added complexity of having deal with the additional degree of freedom via movement on the Z-axis, or the "upward" axis.

The hope would be that we would have a playable game by two weeks or so, at the latest. We split the project into five domains: character, combat, AI, level, and mechanics. These were then paired off into two pairs. Character and level developers were linked while combat and AI were the other. Mechanics affected everything, so it was it's own overarching domain.

## Unfamiliarity to Unity3D
I was hoping that with research and development within Unity3D being a weekly event on Wednesday that troubles pertaining to Unity's workflow would be a non-issue. I thought that until I saw variables tracking the 

In spite of that, I didn't hold code reviews either. I didn't feel as though it was my place to tell someone that their code could be improved in some manner because I didn't normally have to work with their code or ever really see it. I was either working by myself or had someone else to do that job. This time, that job was mine.

## Failure to Lead Progress
A certain someone once said, "Everybody needs an asshole." I wasn't shooting to become the next project manager on someone's hit list, but not everything gets done in a timely manner by itself or else I wouldn't be writing this in the first place. Rather than planning and dreaming that the whole thing would come together, I should have asked everyone to tell me when they could have something done by. I'd then take that and plan out projections for the next week and the subsequent week, assuming that everyone goes according to plan.

What happened when that didn't? "It's fine, we'll just have to push it to next week," is what I thought to myself. I just kept planning and figured that things would get a little crunchy for a week and we'd be back on target.

## Poor Planning
I planned for a prototype to be out the door and in everyone's hands by one week's time. That meant doubling it to two weeks to account for "new project" uneasiness and difficulties in working in Unity3D. Despite breaking two weeks and not having a prototype, I accepted it as a part of "learning to use Unity3D" and as a part of things, not as an indicator that I should have worked doubly as hard or paid even closer attention. I didn't react in a way that signalled that that milestone meant something and that we were off target. If I was fine with it, then there should have been no cause for concern, right?

I also thought coupling two people together on parts of the codebase that affected each other would mean that those two would have someone to bounce ideas and troubles off of. But half of the team was always tied up, so what did that leave the other half? Two of us had external commitments pertaining to source control to take of, and another one was infamously often late or not present. The remaining half would be left to work by itself or wander if they were blocked by a problem or person.

# Wrapping Up
I certainly didn't take a class on being a team leader, but I've learned a lot of lessons since January. Endpoint will make its stand on Thursday and make its case to become the project that makes it into production.
