I haven't quite published anything since 2015, so I figure I owe it to you (and
myself) to write up a new blogpost detailing where I am and what I've learned.
Since this will encompass a fair portion of 2015 as well as the entirety of
2016, this might take a second, so hang on:

## Working Harder and Smarter

I started using [toggl](toggl.com) towards the tail-end of 2014 as a way of
tracking the amount of time I was spending not only working, but projects
or tasks I was working towards. Additionally, I could use it to try to keep
myself accountable so as to have hard numbers to point towards rather than
"feeling" like I had done enough.

Comparatively speaking, I worked a larger number of hours in 2016 than that of
in 2015, which was also the last year that I worked on my intership with
Litesprite as well as my time as a student. Since then, I've taken on more
opportunities to prepare my skills as an instructor while balancing that with
side projects that I've started on the side, now that I've settled more into
the role of essentially a Junior Instructor or Instructor-in-Training.

Additionally, this year will be the first year where I will be tracking my
time as an instructor with a clear division between time spent "instructing" vs.
things like preparation time and other stuff that needs doing around the campus.
In previous years, I had filed it all under a single project that was aptly
named "Asst. Programming Instructor" and naming the individual time entries
differently but I feel as though I'd like to further define what exactly that
constitutes, so I'd like to review my work patterns.

## Developing as a Developer

All signs point towards "GO!" on the projects I've got brewing! Since I left
AIE as a student and joined it as a part of its faculty, I've started working on
a small number of projects through since then.

1. Rocket Can (_canned_ for the time being)
2. V-Bound (closed)
3. Vextar (continuation of V-Bound with a different team)
4. TBYTEConsole (ongoing)
5. Guity (exploring)

The time that I have spent those in conjunction with the exposure I've had with
my technical leads like Ric Colgan (Litesprite) or Esmeralda Salamone (AIE)
have been invaluable. I've learned how to better structure my applications
in a manner that is truly forwarding (some might say... maintainable?) while
also balancing that with the need to prototype or stub out new features
with relative ease in a budding codebase.
