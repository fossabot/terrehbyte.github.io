### Vordisk
After having been first prototyped in Unity, Vordisk is a recreation of Valve's Ricochet game in the Unreal Engine. Players fling disks at each in other in hopes of knocking people off of their platforms and into the void, thus scoring them a point. Certain powerups are made available around the map that allow the attacker to inflict debuffs onto their target such as speed reduction and decapitation.

The project was initially developed in Unity before being moved to the Unreal Engine due to the lack of support for networking in Unity. Unreal Engine has an existing networking layer as well as a Blueprint scripting layer that allow easy modifications to be made to the gameplay logic by designers.

### ZombieRoids

MonoGame was the primary technology used. This project was the first official in-class collaboration between classmates for assessment purposes.

### SpritePacker
![Screenshot of 'SpritePacker']({{ site.baseurl}}/images/projects/packer.png)Tools development has always been an area of interest for me ever since I created a program to pack a set of sprites into a spritesheet. Written in XAML and C#, this program utilizes the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to create a simple Windows application.
