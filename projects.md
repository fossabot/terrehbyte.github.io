*Lead Programmer @ SuperNeko*  
*December 2013 - June 2016*

V-Bound (formerly known as Vordisk) is a multiplayer first person disk shooter
about knocking people off the edge. Decapitate, dismember, freeze, or just plain
push people off the ground and into the abyss to score your way to victory. Or,
well, you could just wait for them to walk right off themselves. ;)

*Solo Developer*  
*March 2014*

create a simple Windows application.
