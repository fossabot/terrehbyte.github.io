### V-Bound
![Screenshot of 'V-Bound']({{ site.baseurl }}/images/projects/V-Bound.png)

*Lead Programmer @ SuperNeko*
*December 2013 - Present*

V-Bound (formerly known as Vordisk) is a multiplayer first person disk shooter about knocking people off the edge. Decapitate, dismember, freeze, or just plain push people off the ground and into the abyss to score your way to victory. Or, well, you could just wait for them to walk right off themselves. ;)

This originally started development as a simple Unity project which we then converted into an Unreal Engine 4 project. Development formally began during June 2015, and has since gone on to show at PAX Prime 2015 and SRGE 2015 as an example of alumni projects from our alma mater, the Academy of Interactive Entertainment. The team is operating under [SuperNeko](http://superneko.com/), an independent games studio located in Seattle, Washington.

*Programming Intern @ Litesprite*
*March 2014 - May 2015*

Sinasprite is a wellness app for Android and iOS that looks to alleviate anxiety and stress in everyday life. I designed mobile UI and UX in Unity3D. Establishing documentation and a high-level API for making web calls out to the database were the critical parts of my assignment at Litesprite.

### SpritePacker

*Solo Developer*
*March 2014*

Tools development has always been an area of interest for me ever since I created a program to pack a set of sprites into a spritesheet. Written in XAML and C#, this program utilizes the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to create a simple Windows application.
