I am an independent game developer with a strong love for programming and arena FPS games. I first picked up Python on my own time while in high school, and later went on to learn how to use C++ and C# while at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment. The Unreal Engine and Unity have been instrumental in learning how to work in those programming languages, and I hope to further expand my skills by picking up JavaScript as well as a bit of web design to do some nice HTML5 work.

I'm always looking for someone to talk to about programming or the games industry as a whole, so send me a message or add me on a social network and chat away!
