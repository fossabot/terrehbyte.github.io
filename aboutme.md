For starters, my name is Terry Nguyen, a student studying at the [Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE)](http://www.theaie.us/), in hopes of getting into the games industry. Before any formal programming courses, I pursued Python 2.x in my spare time through [Byte of Python](http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/), [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/terrehbyte) and [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) before making it into the AIE's Skills Center program. To my surprise, AIE asked me to do an interview for Washington Interactive Network (WIN)'s piece on some of their efforts in <a href="http://washingtoninteractivenetwork.org/blog/aie-skills-center/">funding interactive media training</a>.

After picking up some Unity and Visual Studio usage with C# and C++ respectively, I jumped into their college program and now hope to jump out with the knowledge to not only bust into the games industry but also be a competent programmer, but ready to learn the ins, outs, and quirks of a <em>real</em> game studio or team! I won't learn everything by being at my desk in class, but once I feel like I could pick up anything, I'll know that it's time to move on out towards getting real experience in the industry as an indie or an employee (or both)!
