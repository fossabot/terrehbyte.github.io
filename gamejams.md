### AIE X-Campus Jam of 2014

*Game: [EcoYeti](http://terrehbyte.com/EcoYeti/)*
*Theme: "This has all happened before."*

For the (first?) annual cross-campus game jam, we decided that we should pay homage to an old Windows classic: SkiFree. As opposed to SkiFree where the player is the skier, the player takes the role of the yeti and must defend the egg nests from the skiing poachers! Their dinner is your children, so pay attention!

### Global Game Jam 2014

*Game: [I Am H](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/i-am-h)*
*Theme: "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."*

Playing on the fact that you don't actually see yourself in first person games, I and my fellow game jammers decided that we would make a game where your appearance is determined by the types of actions that you make throughout the course of the adventure. At the end of the game, the sliding scale of karmic justice will grant you a happy or sad image as you peer into a mirror of yourself.
