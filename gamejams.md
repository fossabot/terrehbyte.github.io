### AIE X-Campus Jam of 2014
![Screenshot of 'EcoYeti']({{ site.baseurl}}/images/projects/EcoYeti.png)

*Game: [EcoYeti](http://terrehbyte.com/EcoYeti/)*  
*Theme: "This has all happened before."*

For the (first?) annual AIE cross-campus game jam, we decided that we should pay homage to an old Windows classic: SkiFree. The player takes the role of the yeti and must defend the egg nests from the skiing poachers! Their dinner is your children, so pay attention!

### Global Game Jam 2014
![Screenshot of 'I am H']({{ site.baseurl}}/images/projects/IamH.png)

*Game: [I Am H](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/i-am-h)*  
*Theme: "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."*

Playing on the fact that you don't actually see yourself in first person games, I and my fellow game jammers decided that we would make a game where your appearance is determined by the types of actions that you make throughout the course of the adventure.
