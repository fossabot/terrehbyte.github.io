This script for Team Fortress simplifies the process of setting up and running an Mann vs. Machine listen server. It allows the server to run a config to prep the server for MvM, select an MvM map, and then change the difficulty at any given time during the game.
<p style="text-align:left;">It was crafted with use among friends that don't want to install Metamod:Source and Sourcemod but still want to have the ability to administrate and manage a listen server. Releases and source code are <a href="https://github.com/terrehbyte/mvm-listenserver-script">found at Github</a>.</p>
