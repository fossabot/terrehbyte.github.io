Today, I'm going to try to give Soluto a try again. I picked it up when it had an appearance on Lifehacker, but I later dropped it because it began to be a hassle after some time to work with. It certainly seems like a nifty little tool that'll allow the common end-user to make educated decisions, or in some cases, guesses, about their computer to speed it up by reducing the number of things it has to do.

Currently, here's what I think it does.
<ol>
	<li>Frustrations - What applications crash?</li>
	<li>Apps - What applications are installed?</li>
	<li>Background Apps - What applications are running in the background? (Services @ Start-up)</li>
	<li>Internet - What browser and ISP do you have?</li>
	<li>Protection - What applications and settings do you have set up?</li>
	<li>Hardware - What, roughly, makes up your computer?</li>
</ol>
The only reason why I'm coming back to it is that it's going to feed me information about computers that people often ask me to help them with. I've got a friend that sounds like he might have more computer problems than he should, and I figured that this would be a great opportunity to give this feature a little test run while I try to help his computer. Let's try to keep this blog posted, Terry.
