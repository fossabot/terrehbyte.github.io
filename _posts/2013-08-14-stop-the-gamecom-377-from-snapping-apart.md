If you’re the lucky owner of a Plantronics GameCom 377 or 367, you might have discovered that your headset is <a href="http://soundingboard.plantronics.com/thread/17648" target="_blank">cracking somewhere along the headband</a>. What’s worse is that you can’t even buy a new one in stores, so you’re stuck with buying one from eBay or Amazon if a replacement is what you’re in the market for. Fortunately, if it hasn’t completely snapped apart, despair not for there is still hope! They’re by no means perfect, but these “fixes” should keep your headset together for some time longer.

<h3>Option A - Clamping the Gap in "Plantronics"</h3>

If you’re like me and are looking for an easy fix, but kind of ugly fix, then you may want to consider heading down to a hardware store and picking up a small clamp that you can use to put an iron grip on the two parts. If you also happen to live near a DAISO Japan store, they carry small clamps that you can buy for a dollar.
<h3>Option B - Wrap it Up with Metal</h3>

This solution comes from eriktheg at Head-Fi Forums and involves some ability to work with sheet metal and drills. By wrapping a piece of metal around the crack in the headset, you can create a new band that isn't too high-profile and will make sure that your worries will be a thing of the past. Detailed instructions and diagrams are <a href="http://www.head-fi.org/t/551961/fix-completely-cracked-and-broken-headphones-guide" target="_blank">found at their thread</a>.

If you've solved this problem yourself somehow, would you care to please leave it in the comments somewhere? You could also drop me an e-mail via the <a href="http://terrehbyte.com/lets-talk/" target="_blank">contact page</a>.
