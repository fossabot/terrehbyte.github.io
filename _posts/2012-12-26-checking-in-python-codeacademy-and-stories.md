<p>It's been quite some time since the last update, so let's do a quick rundown of virtually everything that I've done! This'll be a short post.</p><p>1. Python and Codecademy</p><p>In order to supplement the fact that the visual novel project has come to a grinding halt in recent weeks, I'm reviewing and picking up on additional things through lessons at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. I'm still sticking with the Ren'Py visual novel engine, so that isn't changing. I've been flow charting the common route, and though having a point-based decision system sounds nice, I've concluded that a simple diverging route should be more than enough for me.</p><p>2. Stories</p><p>The visual novel project has come to a halt but not because I don't want to work it. School has been keeping me busy as of late, and although decisions keep coming to me, fitting them all together can prove difficult.</p><p>3. Will I keep working at things?</p><p>Heck yeah, I will keep working at things! I'm rather glad that I'm not paid to write or program a visual novel because I'd probably do a terrible job, I'd be burnt out, and I'd be fresh out of ideas in a week.</p>
